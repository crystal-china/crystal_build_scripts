# Dependencies

You'll need to run this using [podman](https://github.com/containers/podman). check out the [Installation Instructions](instli)
for how to set it up.

Podman works pretty much the same way as Docker, so using Docker might work instead, 
but I can't guarantee it.

Honestly, I can't see why anyone would still use Docker! 

You can switch to Podman easily and painlessly without any issues, plus you get 
these awesome benefits:

1. No need to start a dockerd daemon anymore.
2. podman = docker + docker-compose + docker buildx + pod manager
3. It's (way) faster than Docker.
4. Say goodbye to fixuid!

# How to build Crystal binary

## For a Crystal AMD64 static binary

```sh
# For shards managed project
$: crystal_build_amd64_binary # built binary will land in the `bin/` folder.

# Build one file
$: crystal_build_amd64_binary foo.cr # built binary will land in current folder.
```

## For a Crystal ARM64 static binary

```sh
# For shards managed project
$: crystal_build_arm64_binary

# Build one file
$: crystal_build_arm64_binary foo.cr
```

## Passing build flags

You can find all the default build arguments in the sample file: [build_flags.conf.sample](/bin/build_flags.conf.sample).

```conf
compile_time_flags=-Dstrict_multi_assign -Dno_number_autocast -Duse_pcre2 -Dpreview_overload_order

# Don't add --progress, it's not work well with this script!
flags=--release --no-debug --stats --time

link_flags=--link-flags=-Wl,-L/app --link-flags=-s --link-flags=-pie
```

Just rename that file to build_flags.conf, set your arguments there, and both scripts
will automatically pick them up.

The only option you can pass is `-f` (force). If you use it, the cache will be invalidated 
and the script will rerun `shards install` to fetch all your dependencies again.

## Cross-Compiling a static binary for general C programs

You can also use this for general C programs, assuming the toolchains support it.

```sh
# To build an AMD64 binary (This is the default)
$: build_binary

# To build an ARM64 binary 
$: PLATFORM=linux/arm64/v8 build_binary
```

By default, the script runs the command: `make CC=gcc LDFLAGS=-static`.

You can easily override this default command by just passing your preferred command
directly, like this:

```sh
$: build_binary make
```

currently support platform is:

"linux/arm64/v8" "linux/arm/v7" "linux/arm/v6" "linux/amd64" "linux/386"

You can run the command below to get additional platform information:

```sh
$ podman run --rm mplatform/mquery alpine:latest
```
